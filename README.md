MvcAuthorization is an authorization library for ASP.NET MVC. The original concept can be located on my [blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224163635/http://www.ryanmwright.com/).

## Features

- Configuration based out of the box
- Utilizes a provider model to allow for non config based storage (such as a database)
- Works with any IoC container
- Comes with policy handling support and default policy handlers for most needs
- Allows implementation of custom policy handling

## Getting Started

1. Download the NuGet package by running **Install-Package MvcAuthorization** from the package manager console
1. Update your web.config by applying roles and policies
1. Run your project and see the results

Be sure to check out the documentation for more information. I am always open to suggestions on how to improve the library. If you have any let me know in the [discussions](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=mvcauthorization) section.
